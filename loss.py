The slim, springy ear section grips securely like an E6 classic, while the flexible front boom takes abuse like the E6i and provides precise placement and easy reshaping. The ultra miniature directional element delivers exceptional sound quality and rejects surrounding noise or feedback from stage monitors and nearby speakers. As part of the Countryman E6 Directional line, the E6 Flex Directional features swapable reinforced cables, versatile skin tone options, changeable caps for cardioid or hypercardioid patterns, and rugged construction. It weighs less than one-tenth ounce and virtually disappears against the skin, so performers forget they're even wearing a mic.The fit of the classic E6 meets the flexibility of the E6i. The front boom is like an E6i, the ear section is like the classic E6, the result is the best fitting, easiest to use earset available. Country Earsets are the smallest, lightest, and least visible head-worn microphones. The E6 Flex comes in four skin tones to disappear against the face. Changeable protective caps let you switch between cardioid and hypercardioid patterns in seconds.Frequency response is better than 30Hz to 15kHz with smooth off-axis response and >100dB dynamic range. Countryman Earsets sound like world-class, full-size performance mics but the performer has complete freedom. The E6i is exceptionally resistant to makeup, sweat and moisture when used with the supplied protective caps. The skin-colored, almost unbreakable boom resists water, sweat, and makeup and can be bent and re-bent many times to fit different performers. The front boom of the E6 Flex is slightly firmer than the E6i, so it's easily shaped right on the performer's face and smooths out for a professional look.The E6 Flex comes in three sensitivities for different speaking or singing styles, with up to 140 dB SPL capability.
